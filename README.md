# AIHRo : Artificial intelligent Hummanoid Robot

Imagine about a humanoid robot that you can teach a task using your hand gesture and repeat the task any number of times just with a command. Further if the humanoid robot can chat and answer any of your queries. Isnâ€™t it unique and innovative? This concept has become a reality through this project.

An artificial intelligent robot possessed with a lot of functionalities. The robot can interact merely like a human i.e. in the same way as we talk to a human. It is designed with a gesture recognition and precise mechanical movement control system for physical interaction. It also have the ability to differentiate between casual talk and voice commands. The important function is that it can learn a task from the traning and can redo the task when demanded. The robot can be applied on various fields such as security, medicine, guidance, disaster relief, military and nuclear power. Since the robot can be easily trained by any functions using gestures. It can be used in industries where varieties of tasks are going on.
